🎓 Software Testing Capstone Project: Kerala Tourism Web Application
----------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Objective
-------------
To validate the functional, security, responsiveness and performance aspects of a tourism website using modern testing methodologies and tools.


✨ Project Highlights
----------------------
- Full-cycle QA implementation — from manual to automation.
- Multi-tool integration (Selenium, Playwright, JMeter, OWASP ZAP, Burpe Suite).
- Real-time reports, dashboards, and CI/CD pipeline.

🌟 Project Overview
----------------------
This project focuses on end-to-end testing of a live website hosted on GitHub Pages. The goal is to evaluate the site’s functionality, performance, security, and automation readiness using industry-standard tools and techniques. It showcases proficiency in the entire software testing lifecycle (STLC), from test planning and documentation to advanced, multi-tool test automation and comprehensive defect reporting.The core goal was to implement and compare different modern automation solutions to ensure functionality, security, and cross-browser reliability of key user flows, including Login and Signup.

Selenium WebDriver                                         

Foundation for functional and cross-browser testing.


⚡ Modern UI/API

Playwright for Java 

Utilized for superior performance, trace viewing, and direct API testing capabilities.


✨ Concise UI/BDD

Selenide

Integrated for clean, fluent testing syntax and BDD-style test creation.


🏗 Framework Design  

Page Object Model (POM)

Implemented across all automation tools for code maintainability and reusability.


⚙️ Build Tool

Maven 

Dependency management and test execution orchestration.


🧾 Reporting  

TestNG    

Used for execution, grouping, and generating initial HTML reports.


🚀 CI/CD (Demo)

GitHub Actions  

Set up a basic pipeline to trigger automated tests upon code push.


🔍 Testing Scope
-------------------

✅ Manual Testing
-------------------
Functional testing of login, registration, navigation, and form validation
UI/UX observations and defect reporting with severity levels
Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

🤖 Automation Testing
-----------------------
Automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG
Modular framework with reusable methods and assertions
Execution reports with screenshots and logs

🔐 Security Testing (Basic)
----------------------------
Vulnerability scanning using OWASP ZAP
Identified issues related to input validation and session handling

🚀 Performance Testing
-----------------------
Load and stress testing using JMeter
Simulated concurrent users and analyzed response times

Documented :- Created professional artifacts including a Test Plan Document, a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM), and a Detailed Defect Report with Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
