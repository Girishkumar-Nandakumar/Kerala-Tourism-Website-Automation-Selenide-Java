🎓 Software Testing Capstone Project: Kerala Tourism Web Application
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Objective
-------------
To validate the functional, security, responsiveness, and performance aspects of a tourism website using modern testing methodologies and a unified automation framework based on Selenide (Java).


✨ Project Highlights
----------------------
End-to-end QA lifecycle — from Manual Testing → Automation → Performance → Security.

Unified automation framework built with Selenide + Java + TestNG + Maven.

Integration with CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated execution.

Professional QA documentation: Test Plan, RTM, Defect Report, and Performance Analysis.

🧩 UI Automation                        	Selenide (Java)	                      Simplified Selenium wrapper for fluent, BDD-style syntax.
⚙️ Framework Design	                  Page Object Model (POM)	                        Ensures maintainability and modularity.
🧾 Test Management & Execution	              TestNG	                          Handles grouping, prioritization, and report generation.
📦 Build Tool	                                Maven	                                  Manages dependencies and test execution.
🚀 CI/CD	                                GitHub Actions	                            Triggers automated tests on push events.
⚡ Modern UI/API Testing	      Playwright for Java (optional extension)	          Used for fast UI and API testing with trace viewing.
🧰 Performance Testing	                  Apache JMeter	                              Performed Load, Stress, Spike, and Soak tests.
🔐 Security Testing	                    OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite	                    Identified input validation and session management issues.

🔍 Testing Scope
--------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Manual Testing
---------------------------------------------------
Functional testing of login, signup, navigation, and form validation.

UI/UX validation with severity-based defect reporting.

Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.


🤖 Automation Testing (Selenide + Java)
-----------------------------------------

Developed automation scripts using Selenide for smooth UI testing.

Implemented Page Object Model (POM) for reusability.

Integrated TestNG for parallel execution and reporting.

Added screenshots & logs for failure capture.

🔐 Security Testing
--------------------

Scanned the site with OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.

Verified for vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, cookie security, and data exposure.

Reported and documented findings as per DPDP Act compliance.


🚀 Performance Testing (JMeter)
--------------------------------

Conducted Baseline, Load, Stress, Spike, and Soak tests.

Simulated user traffic (up to 5000 virtual users).

Analyzed response times, throughput, and bottlenecks.
